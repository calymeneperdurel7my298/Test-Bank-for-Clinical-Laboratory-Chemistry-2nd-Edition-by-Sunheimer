  * Clinical Laboratory Chemistry is a part of Pearson’s Clinical Laboratory Science series of textbooks, which is designed to balance theory and application in an engaging and useful way. Highly readable, the book concentrates on clinically significant analyses students are likely to encounter in the lab. The combination of detailed technical information and real-life case studies helps learners envision themselves as members of the health care team, providing the laboratory services specific to chemistry that assist in patient care. The book’s fundamental approach and special features allow students to analyze and synthesize information, and better understand the ever-evolving nature of clinical chemistry. The Second Edition has been streamlined and updated to include four new chapters covering safety, pediatrics, geriatrics, and nutrition; real-life mini cases; new figures and photographs; updated sources and citations; and a complete teaching and learning package.
